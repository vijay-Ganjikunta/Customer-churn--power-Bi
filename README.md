### Project__: __Customer Churn Analysis for a Bank__
__Problem Statement__: 
Understanding what drives a customer to leave is crucial for banks. Churn prevention enables banks to create loyalty programs and retention campaigns, aiming to keep as many customers as possible.
__Objective__: 
The objective or goal of this project is to analyze customer churn within a bank, identify key factors contributing to customer exit, and provide insights that can help the bank develop strategies to retain customers and reduce churn. By leveraging data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, and data visualization techniques in Power BI, the project aims to achieve the following:
Task List:

 1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Handle mixed data types and rectify data types as needed.
   - Import data from CSV and Excel files, promoting column headers and ensuring data consistency.

 2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Created a star schema using dimension and fact tables.
   - Developed a Master Date table for efficient data management.

 3. **DAX Calculation:**
   - Create DAX formulas to calculate key metrics such as Total Customers, Active Customers, Inactive Customers, and Exit 
     Customers.
   - Use DAX to identify Credit and Non-Credit Card Holders and categorize customers by Credit Score (Fair, Poor, Good, Very 
     Good, Excellent).
   - Implement the `SWITCH` function for Credit Type categorization.
   - Calculate Previous Year Exit Customers for comparison.

 4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Design visualizations to track Active vs. Inactive Customers by Year.
   - Create charts for Exit Customers, including comparisons with Previous Year Exit Customers.
   - Visualize Exit Customers by Gender and Credit Score Type.
   - Develop visualizations to display Exit Customers by Credit and Non-Credit Categories.

 5. **Slicers:**
   - Implement slicers to filter data by Year, Month, and Location.
   - Add slicers to filter Exit and Retained Customers.

### Insights from the Project:
- Analyze year-wise trends in Active and Inactive Customers.
- Identify patterns in Exit Customers by Gender and Credit Score Types.
- Compare Exit Customers with Previous Year trends.

### Learning from the Project:
- Improved data cleaning and preparation skills, especially handling mixed data types.
- Developed proficiency in DAX formulas for calculating key metrics and creating custom functions like `SWITCH`.
- Enhanced visualization techniques for effective communication of insights.
- Gained a deeper understanding of customer churn in the banking industry.
